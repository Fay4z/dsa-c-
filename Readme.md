# Data Structures and Algorithms Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to learning and implementing various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts. This repository also serves as a personal learning journey and a resource for others interested in DSA.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** C, C++
- **Version Control:** Git, Github

## Repository Structure

- `/data_structures`: Implementation of various data structures
- `/algorithms`: Implementation of different algorithms
- `/problems`: Solutions to DSA problems
- `/notes`: Markdown files containing explanations and theory

## Learning Objectives

- Understand fundamental data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs)
- Implement classic algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, graph traversals)
- Analyze time and space complexity of algorithms
- Solve coding problems efficiently using appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Improve problem-solving skills and coding practices
